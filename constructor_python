Constructor in Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Python | Python Programming
Constructor: Constructor are just a special type of method. It is called automatically during object creation of a class.Constructors are used generally to initializing the value. The constructor is called automatically, when an object of class is created. Constructor does the work to initialize or assign the values to the members (class variables and class methods) of the class. The method named  __init__() is the constructor in python. It is called always when an object is created.

Syntax of creating constructor:

#Syntax of defining constructor in python

def __init__(self):
    # body of the constructor
Types of Constructors: There are two types of constructors.
1). Default Constructor
2). Parameterized Constructor

class demo:
    def _init_(self):
        no=32
        if(no%5==0):
            print("Divisible by 5")
        else:
            print("Not divisible")
    def findsum(self,a,b):
        s=a+b
        return(s)
a=int(input("enter first no"))
b=int(input("second no"))
obj = demo()
s = obj.findsum(a,b)
print("ANswer=",s)

class demo:
    def _init_(self):
        no=4
        ans=no*no
        print("Square =",ans)
    def findsum(self,a,b):
        s=a+b
        return(s)
a=int(input("enter first no"))
b=int(input("second no"))
obj = demo()
s = obj.findsum(a,b)
print("ANswer=",s)
